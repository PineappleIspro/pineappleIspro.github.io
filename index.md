## **Working in RStudio**

I have always wondered what our tax money has been used for and/or will be used for and this seemed like a perfect opportunity to see where and how they expect to use our tax dollars. This week I look into exactly which parts of the government are expected to recieve the most money and how they are allocated in each part. With Rstudio I was able to clean up the csv file and make it easier to look at the more specific information such as how Canada plans to spend 3.6 billion on rentals next year or how they are planning to pay 20b in debt charges.

Something to take note off while working in this topic is that, 2021-2022 should be the year with many facilities opening back up with covid ending hopefully by the end of 2021 and certain things like the via rail and other services the government providing taking extra steps to keep people safe. These all may affect how much they are spending.

## **Working in Excel with a csv file**

Working in Excel makes it easier to make graphs and see how our tax money is spent. From the graph. From the graph you can see that most of our tax money goes toward Transfer Payments, which include things such as health care, post-secondary education, social services and more. They plan to spend over 270 billion dollars in the year 2021-2022 though most of the care they provide still seems lacking which begs the question how efficiently are these dollars spent.
